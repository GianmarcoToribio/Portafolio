# Images Directory

This directory should contain all the image assets for your portfolio. Here's what you'll need to add:

## Required Images

1. **Profile Image**
   - Create a folder named `profile.jpg` in this directory
   - This should be a professional headshot or profile picture

2. **Project Images**
   - Create a subdirectory called `projects`
   - Add the following images (or similar alternatives):
     - `ecommerce.jpg`
     - `corporate.jpg`
     - `booking.jpg`
     - `cms.jpg`

## Image Guidelines

- Use high-quality, professional images
- Optimize images for web (compress them to reduce file size)
- For project screenshots, use 1200 x 800px dimensions
- For your profile photo, a square image (e.g., 500 x 500px) works best

## Placeholder Options

If you don't have your own images yet, you can use free stock photos from:
- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
- [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)

Remember to replace these placeholders with your actual work samples and photos when available.
