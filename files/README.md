# Files Directory

This directory should contain downloadable files for your portfolio, such as your resume.

## Required Files

1. **Resume/CV**
   - Add your resume as `resume.pdf` in this directory
   - Make sure it's up to date and formatted professionally

## Files Guidelines

- Use PDF format for resumes and other documents to ensure compatibility
- Keep file sizes reasonable (under 2MB)
- Include contact information on your resume that matches what's in your portfolio

## Placeholder Options

If you don't have a resume file ready yet, you can:
1. Create a simple placeholder PDF that states "Resume Coming Soon"
2. Use a resume template from services like Google Docs, Microsoft Word, or Canva to create one

Remember to replace any placeholder files with your actual documents when available.
